                            <p>Flemish universities evaluate admission applications by refugees just like other
                                applications by foreign students unless they submit files with missing elements. Based
                                on pre-qualifications required for the targeted study programme, refugees are, under
                                normal conditions, allowed access to requested study programmes from a certain entry
                                point based on how they meet admission requirements to include completeness of
                                application documents. </p><br>

                            <p>So, let’s say, you are holder of a 4-year bachelor’s degree in electronics and ICT and as
                                such an engineer in your home country. You want to complete a master’s program in the
                                same field in the University of Antwerp. Based on your previous educational and
                                professional background, the university may accept you from the second or third year of
                                bachelor’s or first year of master’s programme. The chances of being accepted from the
                                first year of bachelor’s or second year of master’s are low. The former is for obvious
                                reasons and the latter is in general terms related to your language skills and the
                                nature of last year in master’s, a year generally devoted to completion of a thesis
                                which does not allow much time for instruction. </p><br>
                            <p>In general, bachelor’s programmes are taught in Dutch and master’s, advanced master’s or
                                postgraduate programmes are taught in English and Dutch. </p><br>
                            <p>The universities are independent, and they do not need a NARIC decision to accept a
                                foreign or refugee student. In other words, any refugee willing to follow a programme in
                                any Flemish university has no necessity to apply for diploma recognition through NARIC.
                                Flemish universities are competent in evaluating the applicant’s academic and
                                professional background and linking him / her to a suitable programme. This is true even
                                when a refugee applies with missing documents. In this case, the university conducts an
                                interview and starts a verification process to rightly link the applicant to the
                                suitable programme and year. </p><br>
                            <p>Once an application has been made to a programme, the university [programme selection
                                board] will first decide to admit or not the student to the requested programme. If
                                accepted, a refugee student has to request exemption from courses (s)he has completed in
                                previous studies. Then the programme board decides on which classes or courses the
                                applicant will be exempted. </p><br>
                            <p>Bachelor’s programmes take three years to complete and require attaining 180 ECTS
                                (European credits). You should be aware that bachelor’s programmes in Belgium and in
                                your home, country may not mean the same thing. For example, in Turkey, engineers should
                                follow a four-year study programme. For master’s they need to complete another two years
                                of education. Holding a four-year degree is enough to work as an engineer. In the same
                                country, there is another two-year higher education programme called “yüksek okul” or
                                “high school literally”. Those institutions are part of universities and their graduates
                                are generally technicians, pharmacy assistants, nurses. </p><br>

                            <p>In Belgium, in most cases, an academic bachelor’s degree does not give direct access to
                                the labor market. But you have to have a master’s degree. So, let’s say you were a
                                pharmacist in Turkey graduating from a four-year programme. Upon arrival you applied for
                                equivalence and you got equivalence for bachelor’s degree only. You cannot work as a
                                pharmacy assistant in Belgium. That requires another layer of additional education and

                                master’s degree. </p><br>
                            <p>So, for a person coming from Turkey, it is integral to complete a master’s programme if
                                (s)he wants to work as an engineer. </p><br>
                            <p>Master’s programmes on the other hand, take two years in most exact sciences and one year
                                in humanities to complete and require attaining 120 or 60 ECTS (European credits). To
                                start a master’s programme, an applicant should be holder of at least a three-year
                                programme. Many master’s programmes are taught in both English and Dutch and require a
                                bachelor’s degree in the specific field. </p><br>
                            <p>There is also an advanced master’s option that requires the applicant to be a holder of a
                                master's degree. The programmes take one year to complete with 60 ECTS. </p><br>
                            <p>Last option is a postgraduate programme. These are tailored education programmes totaling
                                to 20 ECTS minimum. Upon completion, you will receive a certificate instead of a
                                diploma. </p><br>

                            <p>If you have a valid secondary school, bachelor’s or master’s diploma you can enroll in
                                any of the five research universities and 13 university colleges in Flanders. The main
                                difference between the two is that in university colleges there are no master’s or above
                                programmes and education is more academic oriented. University colleges offer
                                professional and advanced bachelor’s programmes whereas universities offer academic
                                bachelor’s programmes. </p><br>
                            <p>In most basic terms, professional bachelor programmes prepare students for specific
                                professions in industry, education, commerce, agriculture, health and rehabilitation,
                                social work, informatics, applied arts or the media. Courses are therefore
                                practice-oriented and include periods of work placement. These degrees are only awarded
                                by the university colleges. Some university colleges offer profession-oriented
                                specialization programmes for holders of a Professional Bachelor Degree. These Advanced
                                Bachelor Programmes cover at least 60 ECTS credits. Academic Bachelor Programmes prepare
                                students for studies at master's level. These degrees are awarded by universities and
                                some university colleges. For more info you can consult <a

                            <br>
                            <p>Second step is to prove you have adequate skills in the instruction language. Generally,
                                B2 for general and C1 for language related programmes is stipulated. But different
                                universities may require different exam results for certification. To set up an example,
                                here is <a

                                for language requirements to follow academic bachelor programmes taught

                                to follow master’s
                                programmes in English in KU Leuven. Please be advised, university colleges may have
                                different and, in some cases, lower standards. You need to check the targeted college

                                                        education, you may have
                                                        applied to diploma recognition at NARIC. There are cases where
                                                        NARIC decisions helped the applicant to be exempted from more
                                                        classes and some other cases where the applicant has got more
                                                        exemptions directly by the university [programme selection
                                                        board] without the decision. So, the applicant should be agile
                                                        and develop a strategy during applications. At the end of the

                                                        members and there might be different decisions. So our advice
                                                        would be that you apply to different universities for the same
                                                        programmes with and without NARIC decision and make registration
                                                        to the program that furthers most your interests. This is even
                                                        true when you do not have a NARIC decision. </p>
