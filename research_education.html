                                <hr>
                                <p>For HER/HOA willing to start an academic career as junior researchers, the first step
                                    should be to follow a PhD programme. Although in many countries PhD can be a higher
                                    education that can be made alongside a main profession, in Belgium, PhD is
                                    considered a “job” that requires immense dedication of time and effort and as such
                                    should come alongside a salary. </p> <br>

                                <p>There are rare examples where a candidate wants to follow a PhD programme without
                                    remuneration. Even in such cases, the researcher is registered in the university as
                                    a volunteer worker. </p> <br>

                                <p>A finished PhD is a success both for the candidate and the Professor. For that
                                    reason, in most cases professors in Flemish universities accept proposals of
                                    candidates from their classes that they know in order not to set themselves for an
                                    adventure with an unknown end. If they sense a certain aspect within the proposal or
                                    profile of the candidate will add value or see a shine of success, they accept them
                                    to the PhD programme. </p> <br>

                                <p>So, as a HER/HOA, you are about to set sails into this relatively hard environment.
                                    If you want to make a funded PhD below you will find advice on where to look for and
                                    what options you have. But if not, in other words if you want to work in a job other
                                    than a researcher and make a PhD alongside that, you are doing something uncommon.
                                    As this will leave less time for research, it will probably take longer. If you have
                                    academic ambitions this is likely not the best option. </p> <br>

                                <p>You should also note, the professors should see parallels between the professional
                                    background or profession you exercise and the potential to successfully finish your
                                    PhD alongside daily routine. </p> <br>

                                <p>If you have the passion to become a researcher or you already were one in your home
                                    country and want to continue in this pursuit in Belgium, following information can
                                    be helpful to outline a professional / research trajectory. </p> <br>

                                <hr>
                                <p>For PhD, most universities in Flanders do not require completion of compulsory
                                    courses. But the system requires collection of a specific number of points earned
                                    across a variety of activities to include publications, lecturing or organizing /
                                    joining events, conferences or academic gatherings etc. In this regard, a PhD
                                    student can take courses to earn points or as his research requires attaining
                                    certain knowledge or competences. </p><br>
                                <p>The PhD programs has been based upon writing a thesis as one stand-alone study or as
                                    one consisting of chapters structured around three / four (subject to change
                                    depending on faculty and department) articles to be published in peer reviewed
                                    academic journals in close coordination with the promoter and defending the thesis
                                    in the end of the program normally lasting about four years. </p><br>
                                <p>But before starting your journey to become a researcher the first thing you should do
                                    is to make sure that you are in possession of a master’s degree that will be
                                    recognized by the university. If your diploma is outside the European Economic Area,
                                    you may apply to NARIC for the equivalence of your diploma. NARIC evaluates your
                                    diploma in level or specific recognition, so that you may apply for specific
                                    recognition of your PhD, or your master’s degree for both recognitions. Despite
                                    individual differences, nearly all Flemish universities recognize diplomas granted
                                    by universities in Europe, the US and Canada. </p><br>
                                <p>The next step should be to find the right professor to support you throughout your
                                    PhD. All professors have introductory web pages within their respective university’s
                                    web pages detailing their research areas, courses they teach and publications. A
                                    survey on those web pages will give you an idea about which professor would be
                                    interested in supporting your research.</p><br>
                                <p>Following step is to prepare a CV detailing your prior academic background and works,
                                    a thesis / project proposal or a summary of intended research to be sent to the
                                    professor. It makes a good impression if your plans are detailed and show a grasp of
                                    current literature/scientific debates.</p><br>
                                <p>The last element to be completed to start research is to find funding. In many cases,
                                    the professor will not accept a PhD student if (s)he has not solved the issue of
                                    funding. Or in some other cases the professor will help students find a scholarship
                                    from within the research budget of the university or else will show where to look
                                    for. Now we will further delve into specifics of the funding options:</p><br>

                                <p>There are internal Funding options that can be found along three main axes. Those
                                    are: </p>

                                <h4 class="font-weight-normal mb-2 pb-2">Option 1: Working as a researcher on a
                                    funded project (FWO, VLAIO, EU, Belspo, Horizon 2020, ISF, ESF, …)</h4>
                                <p>You can be hired as an employee within the framework of a scientific project, which
                                    in any many cases leads to a PhD. But those could be short term projects too.
                                    Project workers are considered non-statutory academic personnel (BAP-Bijzonder
                                    Academisch Personeel). They are employed under a contract and pay taxes like any
                                    other employee. What’s more, during applications, there are no prior restrictions
                                    concerning the origin of the diplomas of candidates.</p><br>

                                <p>In general terms, BAPs are contracted on a 2+2 years basis, meaning initially sign a
                                    2-year contract and are asked to renew the contract at the end of those 2 years. It
                                    is good to know that universities have no formal obligation to make announcements
                                    for PhD positions available on projects. For some they make announcements and some
                                    others do not. So, a candidate should primarily actively seek vacancy announcements
                                    of Flemish universities and should also contact professors directly and inquire
                                    whether any project funding is available. </p><br>
                                <p>Based on the nature of the project (international, regional, local) English may be
                                    sufficient to apply / be employed. In other cases, the applicant will be expected to
                                    have good knowledge of Dutch. If needed you have to reach a high level of language
                                    skill in order to practice your profession, you should follow a course preferably in
                                    a university institution. The risk in this option for the candidate is that (s)he
                                    may not be able to conduct research in his / her dream field. </p><br>
                                <h4 class="font-weight-normal mb-2 pb-2">Option 2: Becoming a member of the Assistant
                                    Academic Personnel (AAP-Assisterend Academisch Personeel)</h4>
                                <p>AAPs combine their own doctoral research with assistant teaching tasks alongside one
                                    or more professors. As in the case of BAPs, applicants should actively seek
                                    vacancies of Flemish universities, and prepare required documents as delineated in
                                    the calls to be accepted. As opposed to BAPs, Flemish universities are indeed
                                    formally required to publicly announce vacancies for AAP positions </p><br>
                                <p>AAPs are contracted on a 2+2+2 years basis and their workload is distributed equally
                                    between research and teaching. Calls openly specify the qualifications required in
                                    the sought person and define precisely the election process. Some calls also contain
                                    a clause requiring the applicant to have a good level of Dutch or the call itself is
                                    in Dutch. In AAP positions, based on the burden of teaching, knowledge of Dutch is
                                    in most cases an obligation. </p><br>
                                <p>Holders of AAP positions are on the payroll (via employment contract) of the
                                    university and pay taxes like a regular employee. </p><br>
                                <h4 class="font-weight-normal mb-2 pb-2">Option 3: A personal fellowship/mandate

                                <p>For this option, there are mainly three sub-options. Those are: </p><br>

                                        win-win for doctoral students, companies and universities. In this regard, VLAIO
                                        has one type of mandates for doctoral research, Baekeland that could be
                                        benefitted from by candidates. <br>With Baekeland mandates, VLAIO wants to offer
                                        individual researchers the opportunity to carry out a PhD in close collaboration
                                        with the business community. The Baekeland mandate involves, on the one hand, a
                                        Flemish company that determines the strategic orientation of the project and
                                        provides co-financing, and, on the other hand, a Flemish university that is
                                        responsible for supervising and awarding a doctorate in accordance with current
                                        quality standards. The work can take place at both the knowledge institution and
                                        the company. <br>If you have expertise on a subject and have a proposal of
                                        research that you think will offer clear economic added value in the event of

                                        Baekeland program is open to mandatories from all scientific fields, all
                                        nationalities and ages with fewer restricting <a

                                        So, if you can find a promoter in a Flemish university that will support your
                                        proposal and a company willing to hire you to implement the project you can do
                                        your PhD and work in that respective company. The company acts as the main
                                        applicant for VLAIO. After approval, the company is granted project-based
                                        support. The personnel and operating costs of the doctoral student are
                                        subsidized to 50% for a large company and 60 to 80% for an SME. <br>The mandate
                                        is interesting in that it allows you to obtain your doctorate, to know the
                                        business world from the inside and see your research results immediately applied
                                        in business. This type of mandate is basically four years. </li>

                                        departure from home country and references. Then the applicant is invited to
                                        join a skype call for an interview. Interviewers try to see if the applicant is
                                        really at risk and if he is passionate about building an academic career rather
                                        than trying to find a source to live in the host country. The applicant is

                                        (s)he would still follow this pursuit. <br>The time difference between first
                                        application and the interview may take up to 6 months. If this step is also
                                        passed successfully, the headquarters in the USA contacts UAF to agree on how
                                        you will be funded. This phase, the period between interview and receipt of
                                        first payment may take some 6 months. So, you should know it takes about one
                                        year until you receive payment after making an application.

                                <p>The payments for PhD education are made in two instalments. Initially a tuition fee
                                    is paid during enrolment and another tuition fee is paid before defence of thesis,
                                    at the end of your PhD. The tuition fee is subject to little increase each year. To
                                    give you an idea, this fee was €461 for 2018-2019 academic year and it is € 469,80
                                    for 2019-2020. So, you will pay around € 950 in total. This amount is universal
                                    across different Flemish universities.
                                    However, you will get more than that during your education in terms of educational
                                    credits.
                                </p><br>
                                <p>Example: PhD students who are enrolled at the University of Antwerp and who are
                                    following the complete doctoral study programme are entitled to receive educational
                                    credit worth 1500 euros in all during their PhD. The educational credit is available
                                    till the end of the academic year in which the public defence takes place.
                                </p><br>
                                <p>Each academic year, 500 euros is added to your balance, so you'll have 500 euros at
                                    your disposal during your first year, (max.) 1000 euros during your second year, and
                                    (max.) 1500 euros in your third PhD year. When you use money to fund an activity,
                                    this amount is deducted from your educational credit.
