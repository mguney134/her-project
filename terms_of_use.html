            <br>
            <h3>Updates for the GDPR</h3> We have just released updates for all of our website and/or plugins to improve
            compliance with the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>What is the GDPR?</h3> As most of you already know, the new EU GDPR will be enforced on May 25th, 2018.
            The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679 is a regulation in EU law on data protection and
            privacy for all individuals within the European Union. It addresses the export of personal data outside the
            EU. The GDPR aims primarily to give control back to citizens and residents over their personal data and to
            simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU.
            Source: <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" target="_blank" rel="">Wikipedia.org</a> For more information
            about the GDPR, please see this <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/smedataprotect/index_en.htm"
                target="_blank" rel=""> Infographic
                from the European Commission</a> and <a href="http://eugdpr.org/" target="_blank" rel=""> GDPR
                Portal.</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Using local fonts instead of Google Fonts</h3> Loading Fonts from the Google Web Fonts API might be not
            compliant with the GDPR since the IP address of your website visitors is personal data and transferred to
            Google for the request.
            <br>
            <br> To ensure GDPR compliance, we have just released updates for our website. After installing the update,
            our website will now embed all fonts locally instead of loading them from Google. You won’t notice any
            visual changes since the themes still use the same fonts, but from your own server.
            <br>
            <br> Installing our latest updates improves compliance with the GDPR but is NO GUARANTEE that your browsers,
            built-in extensions and other components of your networks fully complies to all rules. There might be other
            plugins you are using which are affected by the GDPR. Please contact a GDPR consultant or lawyer to assess
            your complete website.
